- I really, REALLY, need to improve my coding by DRYing up these generators.
  The problem is that I don't understand how to inherit what the hobo
  generators already do and after they're done, kick out some nice rspec
  templates to get our testing jumpstarted.
- Figure out what really needs to be in Rakefile
