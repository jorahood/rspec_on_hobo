Description:
    The hobo_model_resource_spec generator creates stubs for a new model with REST.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs described 
    by name and type. These attributes will be used to prepopulate the migration 
    to create the table for the model and give you a set of predefined fixture.    
    You don't have to think up all attributes up front, but it's a good idea of 
    adding just the baseline of what's needed to start really working with the resource.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, an RSpec spec in
    spec/models, database fixtures in spec/fixtures/plural_name.yml, and a migration
    in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate hobo_model_resource_spec Account

    This will create an Account model:
        Model:      app/models/account.rb
        Spec:       spec/models/account_spec.rb
        Fixtures:   spec/fixtures/accounts.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb

    ./script/generate hobo_model_resource_spec post title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean

	Creates post model with predefined attributes.
